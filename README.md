## Notes

It is very important to note that there are mutliple versions of the simlator included in this project. The 'static' folder contains simlations that have predetermined process execution and were used for development and understanding while the main simulator is in the root directory as simulator.py
\
\
It is also important to note that some of the code for this project was heavily influenced by AI. The reason for this is that none of us had real experience in developing GUI for python programs. We used the AI to make our GUI simulations based on logic that we had written in the CLI versions.
